            </header>
            <p>
                That was a dark dark night,at an alley which people rarely passes.MuZiChaBu was walking by, with the
                blinking streetlight he saw a group of man with black cloth a head and heard a girl asking for help from
                that direction. He ran towards those mans and saw that they were surrounding the girl. Without thinking
                our friend MuZiChaBu yelled:<strong>"LET GO OF THAT GIRL"</strong>

                <h3>The last match</h3>
            </header>
            <p>
                This story is about the last match MuZiChaBu played in the GongDong youth basketball team.
                The score was even.Only 10 seconds left for the game. MuZiChaBu has the control of the ball.He find a
                chance and dashed towards the basket. And from 3 point line he jumped, it was like he could fly. I could
                tell that he got this, he can reach it. But their opponent couldn't watch it happen, one of them made the
                moive, he held on MuZiChaBu´s foot and tried to drag him down. Because of that, MuZiChaBu lost his
                balance. Even so, he still made the dunk and gained the most important score for his team, but sadly when
                he landed his foot broke and since then he couldn´t play basket anymore.

                <h3>What is robots.txt and how have i configure it for my site</h3>
            </header>
            <p>
                In the web there are web robots(programs) which traverse the Web automatically,robots.txt is the file
                used to tell where web robots can and can not access in the website.The protocol of this is called
                The Robots Exclusion Protocol. Configuring a robots.txt is easy, mostly you only use 3 type of commands.
                User-Agent:(you can specify which robots to obey your roles or just put * as all robots),
                Disallow:(the url of the page you don't don't allow it to access or / for all pages),
                Allow:(the url of the page page you allow it to access from those you disallow since you may just want
                to allow one of the page and you have thousand pages).

                <h3>What is humans.txt and how have i configure it for my site</h3>
            </header>
            <p>
                humans.txt is the file you use keep the information about people who created and helped create the site.
                Since owners often don't want authors signing in there site. So basically this file is just to know who
                are the authors of the site and humans.txt should be in the root of the site as robots.txt. When i
                created the humans.txt i just add member information of my team and that is all.

                <h3>What is Open Graph and how do i make use of it</h3>
            </header>
            <p>
                Open Graph and it's protocol The Open Graph Protocol is create by FaceBook. It is used to allow
                integration between FaceBook and it's user data and website. Basically when your page use Open Graph,
                you can choice what elements of your page you want to show when someone share's it. To make use of it i
                added some meta tags in my website to identify what i want to show and that is all. Btw if you want to
                make a image show when someone share´s your site, you may need to check the image size required of the
                site it is shared on.

                <h3>Why is it important to separate the layout and design (css) from content (html)</h3>
            </header>
            <p>
                To avoid duplications.To maintain the HTML semantic while letting CSS handle styling..To easily change
                your stylesheet(like if you have two stylesheet for one page and one day you want this and next day you
                want to change to anther).
